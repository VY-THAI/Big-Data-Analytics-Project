# Big-Data-Analytics-Project
This individual project is about retrieving and analyzing data of an Artist/Band with their music features by using different Data analysis methods such as Social network analysis, Decision tree model, Topic modelling, etc.

In this project, I conducted a detailed case study using social media analytics to enhance the popularity of a music artist or band. The project involved a multi-faceted approach, utilizing RStudio, Gephi, and Tableau for data analysis and visualization.

**Key Components:**

- **Case Study Design:** I defined a specific case study focusing on a music artist or band, identifying relevant social media platforms and data sources to analyze.
- **Data Collection:** I gathered social media data, carefully managing the volume and frequency of data retrieval to avoid API rate limits.
- **Analytical Tools:** Using RStudio, I processed and analyzed the data, applying statistical and text analysis techniques. Gephi was used to visualize social media networks and interactions, while Tableau provided interactive dashboards to present key metrics and trends.
- **Findings and Recommendations:** I evaluated the analysis results to identify patterns and insights that could help improve the artist's or band’s popularity. The findings were detailed in a comprehensive written report, including visualizations and explanations of the analytical methods used.
- **Presentation:** The project was summarized in a recorded video presentation, and I participated in an interview to discuss the report and answer questions about the analysis and recommendations.

The project showcases the ability to integrate social media data analytics with practical strategies to enhance an artist’s or band’s presence and engagement. The GitHub repository includes all R scripts, datasets, and visualizations, with clear documentation and reproducible code.
